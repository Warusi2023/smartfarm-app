# Testing Guide: Weather-Based Smart Alerts

## Pre-Commit Testing Checklist

Use this guide to verify Feature 1 (Weather-Based Smart Alerts) is working correctly before committing.

---

## 🔧 Backend Testing

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Run migration
\i backend/database/migrations/003_add_weather_alerts.sql

# Verify tables created
\dt weather_alerts
\dt alert_preferences
\dt alert_metrics
```

**Expected**: All three tables should exist with correct schema.

### 2. Manual Alert Generation
```bash
# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="your_database_url"
export WEATHER_API_KEY="your_openweather_api_key"

# Run script manually
cd backend
node scripts/generate-weather-alerts.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
🌤️ Starting weather alerts generation...
Time: 2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z
Processing weather alerts for X farms
Generated Y weather alerts
✅ Weather alerts generation complete. Generated Y alerts.
```

**Verify in Database**:
```sql
-- Check alerts were created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM weather_alerts;

-- Check alert details
SELECT id, alert_type, severity, title, is_read, created_at 
FROM weather_alerts 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. API Endpoints Testing

#### Test 1: Get Alerts (Requires Authentication)
```bash
# Get auth token first (login)
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password"}' \
  | jq -r '.data.token')

# Get alerts
curl -X GET https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.'
```

**Expected**: JSON response with `success: true` and `data` array of alerts.

#### Test 2: Get Alert Statistics
```bash
curl -X GET https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.'
```

**Expected**: JSON with `total`, `unread`, `critical`, `high`, `upcoming` counts.

#### Test 3: Mark Alert as Read
```bash
ALERT_ID="your-alert-id"

curl -X PATCH https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts/$ALERT_ID/read \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.'
```

**Expected**: Alert returned with `is_read: true`.

#### Test 4: Dismiss Alert
```bash
curl -X PATCH https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts/$ALERT_ID/dismiss \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.'
```

**Expected**: Alert returned with `is_dismissed: true`.

#### Test 5: Get Preferences
```bash
curl -X GET https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts/preferences \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  | jq '.'
```

**Expected**: User's alert preferences returned.

### 4. Alert Rule Evaluation

**Test Heavy Rain Alert**:
- Set up a farm with coordinates
- Mock weather API response with heavy rain (>20mm/hour)
- Run alert generation
- Verify alert created with type `heavy_rain`

**Test Frost Alert**:
- Mock weather API response with low temperature (<2°C)
- Verify alert created with type `frost` and severity `critical`

**Test Heat Stress Alert**:
- Mock weather API response with high temperature (>35°C)
- Verify alert created with type `heat_stress`
