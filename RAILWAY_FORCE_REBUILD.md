# RAILWAY FORCE REBUILD - EMERGENCY

This file exists to force Railway to completely rebuild everything.

## Problem:
Railway is using a cached Dockerfile that doesn't exist in our repository:
- Tries to copy `web-frontend/package*.json` (doesn't exist)
- Uses `yourlivetracking` user (doesn't exist in our code)
- References old dependencies (not in our package.json)

## Solution:
Complete project restructure to force Railway to rebuild from scratch.
