# SmartFarm Railway Deployment Checklist

## 🚀 **Redeployment Steps**

### **1. Trigger Redeploy on Railway**
- [ ] Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- [ ] Navigate to your SmartFarm web project
- [ ] Go to **Deployments** tab
- [ ] Click **Deploy** or **Redeploy** button

### **2. Monitor Build Logs**
- [ ] Watch for successful build completion
- [ ] Verify no Husky or lifecycle script errors
- [ ] Check that static files are copied to `dist/`
- [ ] Confirm `serve` starts on port 8080

### **3. Test Deployed Application**
- [ ] Visit your Railway URL
- [ ] Verify full SmartFarm application loads (not just API status)
- [ ] Check browser dev tools → Network tab
- [ ] Verify all static files load correctly (CSS, JS, images)
- [ ] Check for any 404 errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables are displayed

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

### **Build Logs Should Show:**
```
✓ Building web-project dependencies
✓ Installing husky@9 as dev dependency
✓ Running guarded prepare script (should exit early)
✓ Building with Vite (no Husky interference)
✓ Copying static files to dist/
✓ Starting serve on port 8080
```

### **Application Should Display:**

- Lifecycle script execution errors
- npm install with scripts enabled
- Docker build failures
- Port binding issues
- 404 errors for static files

## 🎯 **Expected Outcome**

After successful redeployment:
- Railway builds complete without Husky interference

- Static files load correctly from the `dist/` directory
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Application is production-ready and fully functional

## 📞 **If Issues Occur**
