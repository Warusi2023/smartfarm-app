## 📋 **Next Steps for Play Store Submission:**

### **Option 1: Fix KAPT Issue (Recommended)**
1. **Update Java Version**: Ensure Java 11 is being used
2. **Re-enable KAPT**: Uncomment KAPT dependencies in build.gradle.kts
3. **Test Build**: Run `.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease`
4. **Generate AAB**: Run `.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease`

### **Option 2: Use Existing Build (Alternative)**
1. **Use Previous Build**: If you have a working APK/AAB from before
2. **Manual Fixes**: Apply the fixes manually in Android Studio
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all features work correctly

## 🎯 **Immediate Actions:**

### **For Play Store Submission:**
1. **Upload to Play Store**: Follow `play-store-submission-guide.md`
2. **Complete Store Listing**: Use content from `app-store-listing.md`
3. **Upload Screenshots**: Use files from `app-store-screenshots/`
4. **Submit for Review**: Start the Play Store review process

### **For Development:**
1. **Fix KAPT Issue**: Update Java version or JVM arguments
2. **Re-enable Dependencies**: Uncomment KAPT and Hilt
3. **Test Build**: Ensure all features work correctly
4. **Generate Final AAB**: Create the final Play Store bundle
