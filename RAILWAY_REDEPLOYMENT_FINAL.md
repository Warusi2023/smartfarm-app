# Railway Redeployment - Final Steps

## üöÄ **Step 1: Redeploy on Railway**

### **For Web Service (web-production-86d39.up.railway.app):**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Navigate to your web service

2. **Trigger Redeploy:**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click **Deploy** or **Redeploy** button
   - Railway will use the new Dockerfile

3. **Monitor Build Process:**
   - Watch the build logs in real-time
   - Look for these success indicators:
     ```
     ‚úÖ HUSKY=0 ‚Äî skipping husky install
     ‚úÖ npm ci --omit=dev completed
     ‚úÖ npm run build completed
     ‚úÖ Docker build successful
     ```

### **For Backend Service (smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app):**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to your backend service

2. **Trigger Redeploy:**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click **Deploy** or **Redeploy** button

3. **Monitor Build Process:**
   - Watch for successful deployment
   - Verify no Husky-related errors

## üîç **Step 2: Verify Build Logs**

### **What to Look For:**

#### **‚úÖ Success Indicators:**
```
HUSKY=0 ‚Äî skipping husky install
npm ci --omit=dev completed successfully
npm run build completed successfully
Docker build completed successfully
Service started on port 3000
```

#### **‚ùå Error Indicators to Watch:**
```
husky: not found
exit code 127
prepare script failed
npm install failed
Docker build failed
```

### **If You See Errors:**

1. **Husky Errors:**
   - Check that `HUSKY=0` is set in environment variables
   - Verify the guarded prepare script is working

2. **Build Errors:**
   - Check that all required environment variables are set
   - Verify Dockerfile syntax is correct

3. **Port Errors:**
   - Ensure `PORT` is not manually set (Railway sets this automatically)

## üß™ **Step 3: Test Deployed Application**

### **Test Web Application:**
1. **Visit your Railway URL:**
   - `https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app`
   - Should load the full SmartFarm application

2. **Check Application Features:**
   - ‚úÖ Full dashboard loads (not just API status)
   - ‚úÖ All navigation menus work
   - ‚úÖ CSS and JavaScript load correctly
   - ‚úÖ No console errors

### **Test Backend API:**
1. **Health Check:**
   - Visit: `https://smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
   - Should return: `{"ok": true, "service": "SmartFarm Backend"}`

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - Test: `https://smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app/api`
   - Should return API information

## üîß **Step 4: Verify Environment Variables**

### **Web Service Variables:**
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] `CI=1`
- [ ] `HUSKY=0`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN=https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app`
- [ ] `VITE_API_URL=https://smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app/api`
- [ ] `APP_BUILD_TAG=railway`

### **Backend Service Variables:**
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] `CI=1`
- [ ] `HUSKY=0`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN=https://web-production-86d39.up.railway.app`

## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: "Server temporarily unavailable"**
**Solution:**
- Check Railway logs for specific errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure both services are running

### **Issue 2: Web app shows only API status**
**Solution:**
- Check that `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly
- Verify the build completed successfully
- Check that static files are being served

### **Issue 3: CORS errors**
**Solution:**
- Verify `CORS_ORIGIN` matches your frontend URL exactly
- Check that backend is running and accessible

### **Issue 4: Build still fails with Husky errors**
**Solution:**
- Double-check that `HUSKY=0` is set in environment variables
- Verify the guarded prepare script is in both package.json files
- Check that the Dockerfile is being used (not Nixpacks)

## ‚úÖ **Success Checklist**

- [ ] **Railway builds complete successfully**
- [ ] **No Husky errors in build logs**
- [ ] **Web application loads completely**
- [ ] **Backend API responds correctly**
- [ ] **All environment variables are set**
- [ ] **No console errors in browser**
- [ ] **All features work as expected**

## üéØ **Expected Final Result**

After successful redeployment:
- ‚úÖ **Web service**: Full SmartFarm application loads
- ‚úÖ **Backend service**: API responds correctly
- ‚úÖ **No build errors**: Husky is properly disabled
- ‚úÖ **Production ready**: Both services are stable and functional

## üìû **If You Need Help**

1. **Check Railway Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
3. **Test Locally**: Run `HUSKY=0 npm install` to test the guarded script
4. **Contact Support**: If issues persist, share the specific error messages

**Your SmartFarm application should now be fully functional in production!** üöÄ
