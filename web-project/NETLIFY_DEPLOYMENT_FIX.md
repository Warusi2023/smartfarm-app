## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If deployments still fail:**

   - Check build logs for errors

2. **Verify File Structure**
   - Ensure `public/index.html` exists
   - Check that all assets are in `public/` folder
   - Verify `_redirects` file is present

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   cd web-project
   npm run build
   npx http-server public -p 8080
   ```

4. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Verify API URLs are correct
   - Check that API keys are valid

### **Common Issues:**

- **404 on refresh**: Check `_redirects` file

- **API calls fail**: Check environment variables
- **Assets not loading**: Verify file paths in HTML
