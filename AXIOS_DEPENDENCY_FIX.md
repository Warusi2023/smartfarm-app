# Axios Dependency Fix Applied ✅

## 🔍 Issue Identified

The weather alerts route was failing to load with error:
```
❌ Error loading Weather Alerts routes: Cannot find module 'axios'
```

**Root Cause**: `weatherAlertService.js` requires `axios` for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, but `axios` was not listed in `backend/package.json` dependencies.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**Added `axios` to `backend/package.json`**:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "axios": "^1.6.0",
  ...
}
```

**Commit**: `[latest]` - "fix: add axios dependency for weather alerts service"

---

## 📋 What Happens Next

1. **Railway Auto-Deployment**:
   - Railway will detect the change in `package.json`
   - Will run `npm install` during build
   - `axios` will be installed

2. **Route Loading**:
   - Weather alerts route should now load successfully
   - Logs should show: `✅ Weather Alerts routes loaded (after app.use)`

3. **API Endpoint**:
   - `/api/weather-alerts` should return **401** (not 404)
   - Confirms route exists and needs authentication

---

## 🔍 Verify Fix

**After Railway deploys** (wait 2-3 minutes):

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   - Look for: `✅ Weather Alerts routes loaded (after app.use)`
   - Should NOT see: `Cannot find module 'axios'`

2. **Test Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts
   ```
   - **Expected**: HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) - Route exists!
   - **If 404**: Check logs for other errors

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Fix is successful when:
- [ ] Railway logs show "✅ Weather Alerts routes loaded"
- [ ] No "Cannot find module 'axios'" error
- [ ] `/api/weather-alerts` returns 401 (not 404)

---

**Fix applied and pushed. Railway will auto-deploy and install axios!** ✅
