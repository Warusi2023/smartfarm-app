## 📞 **SUPPORT**

**If you encounter issues:**

1. **Railway deployment fails:**
   - Check Railway logs for error messages
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure `backend/server.cjs` exists in repository

2. **CORS still fails after deployment:**
   - Verify Railway logs show "SmartFarm API listening on 3000"
   - Check CORS_ORIGINS includes your domain exactly
   - Clear browser cache and reload

3. **Dashboard still shows errors:**
   - Run verification scripts to identify specific issues
   - Check Network tab in browser DevTools
   - Verify Netlify environment variables

**All the code is ready. Just deploy to Railway and run the verification scripts!** 🎉
