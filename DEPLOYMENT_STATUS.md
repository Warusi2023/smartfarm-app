# Feature 1 Deployment Status - Current State

## 🔍 Automated Verification Results

**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Backend URL**: https://smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app

### Task 1: Backend Deployment Status

**Health Check**: ✅ **PASSING**
- Status Code: 200 OK
- Response: `{"ok":true,"service":"SmartFarm","ts":1764520312606}`
- Backend is accessible and responding

**Weather Alerts Route**: ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION**
- Status Code: 404 Not Found
- Expected: 401 (Unauthorized) - would confirm route exists
- **Issue**: Weather alerts routes are not yet deployed to production

### Analysis

The backend is healthy, but the weather alerts routes (`/api/weather-alerts`) are returning 404, which indicates:

1. **Possible Causes**:
   - Railway hasn't auto-deployed the latest `main` branch code yet
   - Deployment is in progress
   - Routes need to be manually triggered for deployment

2. **Required Actions**:
   - Check Railway dashboard for latest deployment status
   - Verify deployment includes commit with weather alerts routes
   - Manually trigger redeploy if needed
   - Check logs for "Weather Alerts routes loaded" message

## 📋 Next Steps for Manual Execution

### Immediate Action Required

1. **Check Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Navigate to SmartFarm project
   - Check backend service → Deployments tab
   - Verify latest deployment includes recent commits

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Look for deployment with commit hash from `main` branch
   - Check logs for: `✅ Weather Alerts routes loaded`
   - If not present, trigger manual redeploy

3. **After Deployment**:
   - Re-test weather alerts endpoint (should return 401, not 404)
   - Proceed with Task 2 (Database Migration)
