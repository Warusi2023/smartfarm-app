# Weather Alerts Route Fix Applied ✅

## 🔍 Issue Identified

The `/api/weather-alerts` route was returning 404 because the route module was failing to load due to an incorrect import.

## 🐛 Root Cause

**Problem**: `backend/routes/weather-alerts.js` was trying to import `authenticateToken` as a named export:
```javascript
const { authenticateToken } = require('../middleware/auth');
```

**Reality**: `backend/middleware/auth.js` exports a **class** `AuthMiddleware`, not a function `authenticateToken`.

**Result**: When Node.js tried to require the weather-alerts module, it failed because `authenticateToken` was undefined, causing the entire route loading to fail silently (caught by the outer try-catch).

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changed Import in `backend/routes/weather-alerts.js`:

**Before**:
```javascript
const { authenticateToken } = require('../middleware/auth');
```

**After**:
```javascript
const AuthMiddleware = require('../middleware/auth');
const authMiddleware = new AuthMiddleware();
const authenticateToken = authMiddleware.authenticate();
```

### Added Detailed Logging in `backend/server.js`:

Added step-by-step logging to track exactly where initialization fails:
- Log before requiring routes module
- Log after module loaded
- Log before creating service instance
- Log after initialization
- Log before mounting router
- Log after mounting

This will help identify any remaining issues.

## 📝 Changes Committed

**Commit**: `b12ab4f` - "fix: correct authenticateToken import and add detailed logging for weather alerts initialization"
**Status**: ✅ Pushed to `main` branch
**Railway**: Will auto-deploy this fix

## 🔍 Next Steps: Verify Fix

### Step 1: Wait for Railway Deployment

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app)
2. Navigate to SmartFarm project → Backend service
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Wait for deployment to complete (commit `b12ab4f`)

### Step 2: Check Logs

**In Railway Dashboard → Backend service → Logs**, look for:

**✅ Expected Success**:
```
✅ Daily Tips routes loaded
🔍 Initializing Weather Alerts routes...
  → Requiring routes/weather-alerts module...
  → Routes module loaded successfully
  → Requiring services/weatherAlertService module...
  → WeatherAlertService module loaded successfully
  → Creating WeatherAlertService instance...
  → WeatherAlertService instance created
  → Initializing routes with dependencies...
  → Routes initialized
  → Mounting router to /api/weather-alerts...
✅ Weather Alerts routes loaded (after app.use)
```

**❌ If Error Occurs**:
```
🔍 Initializing Weather Alerts routes...
  → [Step where it fails]
❌ Error loading Weather Alerts routes: [error message]
❌ Weather Alerts error stack: [stack trace]
```

### Step 3: Test API Endpoint

**Test Weather Alerts Route**:
```bash
curl -I https://smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ **401 Unauthorized** - Route exists! (This is correct - needs auth token)
- ✅ **200 OK** - If you have valid auth token
- ❌ **404 Not Found** - Route still not loaded (check logs for error)

**With Auth Token** (if you have one):
```bash
curl -X GET https://smartfarm-app-production.up.railway.app/api/weather-alerts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: JSON response with alerts array or empty array

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Fix is successful when:
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs related to weather alerts
- [ ] See all step-by-step logs showing successful initialization
- [ ] `/api/weather-alerts` returns **401** (not 404) - confirms route exists
- [ ] Frontend can call weather alerts API without 404 errors

## 📋 If Still Seeing Errors

If you still see errors after this fix:

1. **Check Railway logs** for the exact error message
2. **Look for** which step failed (from the detailed logs)
3. **Common issues**:
   - Module not found → Check file paths
   - Constructor error → Check WeatherAlertService parameters
   - Database error → Check DATABASE_URL
   - Auth middleware error → Check middleware/auth.js exports

**Share the error details** and we can fix it precisely.

**Check Railway logs now - the route should load successfully!** ✅
